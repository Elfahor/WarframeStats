# WarframeStats

Warframe is a free-to-play looter-shooter game on PC, PS4 and Xbox One, developped by Digital Extremes.

DE provides an API for accessing game data.
This project is a .NET wrapper to this API to allow everyone to easily integrate Warframe-related data in their project. There is also a sample DiscordBot project that shows use of this wrapper. Drop data is taken from http://drops.warframestat.us, world state data from http://ws.warframestat.us. I was planning on using the NexusHub API to get player profile data but it seems to be down.

# Documentation

Documentation will come as soon as I am done with the main parts of the project - likely in a week (because you know, *work*)
